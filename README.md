<p dir="auto">On the birthday of a special friend, I felt like the generic happy birthday text just wasn't gonna
            cut it for me. So I put together this animated web page at the last minute to wish them Happy Birthday.
</p>
<p dir="auto">I decided to publish it so that you can use it to make the special people in your life feel a bit
            more of what they truly are: special.
</p>
  <p dir="auto">Happy wishing!ðŸŽ‰
